Let me summarize what the indoorjs library is doing:

## IndoorJS Codebase Analysis

### Core Components

- **Map.js**: The central controller that:
  - Manages a canvas with fabric.js integration
  - Handles layers, zoom/pan functionality
  - Provides viewport management
  - Connects with grid functionality

- **Grid.js**: Focused on grid rendering:
  - Draws coordinate lines on a canvas
  - Manages axis labels and ticks
  - Handles grid styling and appearance
  - Supports zooming/panning within the grid

- **Base.js**: Simple foundation class:
  - Provides options management
  - Serves as parent class for most components

- **Constants.js**:
  - Contains configuration values
  - Sets up fabric.js object defaults
  - Defines mode constants

### Key Dependencies

The codebase currently uses fabric.js for:
- Canvas object management
- Handling transformations
- Event management
- Rendering optimizations

### Current Status

The codebase appears to be in transition between:
1. A pure canvas implementation (direct canvas API calls)
2. A fabric.js-based implementation (object-oriented canvas)

If you want to limit indoorjs to only grid drawing functionality:
- The Grid.js component can be isolated
- It requires minimal dependencies (just canvas context)
- The Map.js component would need significant refactoring to remove fabric.js
